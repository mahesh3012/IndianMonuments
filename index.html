<div id=intro><h3>India</h3>
<p><strong>India</strong>,officially the <strong>Republic of India</strong>,is a country in South Asia. 
It is the second-most populous country,the seventh-largest country by area,and the most populous democracy in the world. 
Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, 
it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. 
In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.
</p>

<p>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.Their long occupation,initially in varying forms of isolation as 
hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western
margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of
Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.
The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions.By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism and Buddhism
and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.
</p>

<p>A country which has it's cultural roots dating back since 3000 BCE India has proved its architectural heritage since time immemorial.Different types of monuments 
that are still erect today have gained the interests of tourists and scientists all over the world.This site "sanatan" has been made to learn about few of these
monuments.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Monuments are a part of India's, and the whole human race's, heritage. They represent great achievements in art and architecture. 
It is important to preserve them so that we can continue to enjoy them and so that future generations can too -- and learn from them as well.
Innovation in architecture is with no doubt extremely important, but preserving and restoring the old buildings is also important because those old 
monuments are the reflection of our history, they help us to understand and respect people who lived in different eras with different habits and traditions. 
As well the existence of old monuments will help us observe the changes in the societies for a better understanding of the reasons that lead to the development 
of cities and societies and even traditions to the current status. Old buildings are the face of cities they reflect the changes that happened in a city over time, 
they reflect conflicts, wars, and the prosperity of the society, it even reflects the economic condition of the city over time.
