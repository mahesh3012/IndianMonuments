<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Sanchi Stupa is a Buddhist complex, famous for its Great Stupa, on a hilltop at Sanchi Town 
in Raisen District of the State of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is located in 46 
kilometres (29 mi) north-east of Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<p>
The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an
important monument of Indian Architecture.It was originally commissioned by the 
emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick
structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the chhatri, a 
parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter
the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose
wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace
as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately 
carved toranas (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added.
The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. 
The composite flourished until the 11th century.</p>

<div id="history">
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The monuments at Sanchi today comprise a series of 
Buddhist monuments starting from the Maurya Empire period 
(3rd century BCE), continuing with the Gupta Empire period 
(5th century CE), and ending around the 12th century CE.
It is probably the best preserved group of Buddhist monuments 
in India.The oldest, and also the largest monument, is the Great 
Stupa also called Stupa No. 1, initially built under the Mauryas, 
and adorned with one of the Pillars of Ashoka.</p>
<p>During the following centuries, especially under the Shungas and 
the Satavahanas, the Great Stupa was enlarged and decorated with gates 
and railings, and smaller stupas were also built in the vicinity, especially
Stupa No.2, and Stupa No.3.
Simultaneously, various temple structures were also built, down 
to the Gupta Empire period and later. Altogether, Sanchi encompasses most 
of the evolutions of ancient Indian architecture and ancient Buddhist 
architecture in India, from the early stages of Buddhism and its first artistic 
expression, to the decline of the religion in the subcontinent.</p>

<div id="design">
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>Similarities have been found in the designs of the capitals of various areas of northern India from the time of Ashoka to the time of the Satavahanas at Sanchi: particularly between the Pataliputra capital at the Mauryan Empire capital of Pataliputra (3rd century BCE), the pillar capitals at the Sunga Empire Buddhist complex of Bharhut (2nd century BCE), and the pillar capitals of the Satavahanas at Sanchi (1st centuries BCE/CE).</p>
<p>The earliest known example in India, the Pataliputra capital (3rd century BCE) is decorated with rows of repeating rosettes, ovolos and bead and reel mouldings, wave-like scrolls and side volutes with central rosettes, around a prominent central flame palmette, which is the main motif. These are quite similar to Classical Greek designs, and the capital has been described as quasi-Ionic.Greek influence,as well as Persian Achaemenid influence have been suggested.</p>
<p>The Sarnath capital is a pillar capital discovered in the archaeological excavations at the ancient Buddhist site of Sarnath.The pillar displays Ionic volutes and palmettes.It has been variously dated from the 3rd century BCE during the Mauryan Empire period,to the 1st century BCE, during the Sunga Empire period.One of the faces shows a galopping horse carrying a rider, while the other face shows an elephant and its mahaut.</p>
<p>The pillar capital in Bharhut, dated to the 2nd century BCE during the Sunga Empire period, also incorporates many of these characteristics,with a central anta capital with many rosettes, beads-and-reels, as well as a central palmette design.Importantly, recumbent animals (lions, symbols of Buddhism) were added, in the style of the Pillars of Ashoka.</p>
<p>The Sanchi pillar capital is keeping the general design, seen at Bharhut a century earlier, of recumbent lions grouped around a central square-section post, with the central design of a flame palmette, which started with the Pataliputra capital. However the design of the central post is now simpler, with the flame palmette taking all the available room.Elephants were later used to adorn the pillar capitals (still with the central palmette design), and lastly, Yakshas (here the palmette design disappears).</p>
