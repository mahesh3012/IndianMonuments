<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Ajanta Caves are approximately 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments which date from the 2nd century BCE to about 480 CE
 in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state of India.The caves include paintings and rock-cut sculptures described as among the 
finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art, particularly expressive paintings that present emotions through gesture, pose and form.
</p>
<p>According to UNESCO, these are masterpieces of Buddhist religious art that influenced the Indian art that followed.The caves were
 built in two phases, the first phase starting around the 2nd century BCE, while the second phase was built around 400–650 CE, according 
to older accounts, or in a brief period of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship.The site is a protected monument in the care of the 
Archaeological Survey of India,and since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries and worship-halls of different Buddhist traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall 
of rock.The caves also present paintings depicting the past lives and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and
 rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities.Textual records suggest that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a resting 
site for merchants and pilgrims in ancient India.While vivid colours and mural wall-painting were abundant in Indian history as evidenced by 
historical records, Caves 16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the largest corpus of surviving ancient Indian wall-painting.</p>

<div id="history">
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The Ajanta Caves are generally agreed to have been made in two distinct periods, the first during the 2nd century BCE to 1st century CE,
 and a second several centuries later.</p>
<p>The caves consist of 36 identifiable foundations,some of them discovered after the original numbering of the caves from 1 through 29.
 The later-identified caves have been suffixed with the letters of the alphabet, such as 15A, identified between originally numbered caves
 15 and 16.The cave numbering is a convention of convenience, and does not reflect the chronological order of their construction.</p>
<p>The earliest group consists of caves 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15A. The murals in these caves depict stories from the Jatakas.Later caves reflect
 the artistic influence of the Gupta period,but there are differing opinions on which century in which the early caves were built.According 
to Walter Spink, they were made during the period 100 BCE to 100 CE, probably under the patronage of the Hindu Satavahana dynasty 
(230 BCE – c. 220 CE) who ruled the region.Other datings prefer the period of the Maurya Empire (300 BCE to 100 BCE).
Of these, caves 9 and 10 are stupa containing worship halls of chaitya-griha form, and caves 12, 13, and 15A are vihāras (see the 
architecture section below for descriptions of these types).
The first Satavahana period caves lacked figurative sculpture, emphasizing the stupa instead.</p>
<p>According to Spink, once the Satavahana period caves were made, the site was not further developed for a considerable period
 until the mid-5th century.
However, the early caves were in use during this dormant period, and Buddhist pilgrims visited the site, according to the records
 left by Chinese pilgrim Faxian around 400 CE.</p>
<p>The second phase of construction at the Ajanta Caves site began in the 5th century. For a long time it was thought that the later
 caves were made over an extended period from the 4th to the 7th centuries CE,
but in recent decades a series of studies by the leading expert on the caves, Walter M. Spink, have argued that most of the work took 
place over the very brief period from 460 to 480 CE,
during the reign of Hindu Emperor Harishena of the Vākāṭaka dynasty.This view has been criticised by some scholars,
but is now broadly accepted by most authors of general books on Indian art, for example, Huntington and Harle.</p>
<p>The second phase is attributed to the theistic Mahāyāna,or Greater Vehicle tradition of Buddhism.
Caves of the second period are 1–8, 11, 14–29, some possibly extensions of earlier caves. Caves 19, 26, and 29 
are chaitya-grihas, the rest viharas. The most elaborate caves were produced in this period, which included some
 refurbishing and repainting of the early caves.</p>
<p>Spink states that it is possible to establish dating for this period with a very high level of precision; a 
fuller account of his chronology is given below.
Although debate continues, Spink's ideas are increasingly widely accepted, at least in their broad conclusions. 
The Archaeological Survey of India website still presents the traditional dating: "The second phase of paintings 
started around 5th–6th centuries A.D. and continued for the next two centuries".</p>
<p>According to Spink, the construction activity at the incomplete Ajanta Caves was abandoned by wealthy patrons
 in about 480 CE, a few years after the death ofHarishena. However, states Spink, the caves appear to have been in use
 for a period of time as evidenced by the wear of the pivot holes in caves constructed close to 480 CE.
The second phase of constructions and decorations at Ajanta corresponds to the very apogee of Classical India, or India's
 golden age.However, at that time, the Gupta Empire was already weakening from internal political issues and from the assaults 
of the Hūṇas, so that the Vakatakas were actually one of the most powerful empires in India.
Some of the Hūṇas, the Alchon Huns of Toramana, were precisely ruling the neighbouring area of Malwa, at the doorstep of the
 Western Deccan, at the time the Ajanta caves were made.
Through their control of vast areas of northwestern India, the Huns may actually have acted as a cultural bridge between the area 
of Gandhara and the Western Deccan, at the time when the Ajanta or Pitalkhora caves were being decorated with some designs of Gandharan 
inspiration, such as Buddhas dressed in robes with abundant folds.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>Ajanta Caves were built from the Basalt accumulated in the form of igneous rocks. These rocks were accumulated due to the volcanic eruptions 
occurred long back. The workers carved the rock with proper planning as cracks also occurred during the process.

The workers carved pillars, roofs, and idols out of the rocks. Along with this, painting work was also done. Tourists can enter the
 site through a gateway built between cave 15 and cave 16. The gateway is decorated with elephant and snake.</p>
